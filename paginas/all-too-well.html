    <h1>All Too Well</h1>

    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>I walked through the door with you<br />
        The air was cold<br />
        But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I<br />
        Left my scarf there at your sister's house<br />
        And you've still got it<br />
        In your drawer, even now</p>
    <p>Oh, your sweet disposition<br />
        And my wide-eyed gaze<br />
        We're singing in the car getting lost upstate<br />
        Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place<br />
        And I can picture it after all these days</p>
    <p>And I know it's long gone and<br />
        That magic's not here no more<br />
        And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all<br />
        Oh, oh, oh</p>
    <p>'Cause there we are again on that little town street<br />
        You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me<br />
        Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well</p>
    <p>Photo album on the counter<br />
        Your cheeks were turning red<br />
        You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed<br />
        And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team<br />
        You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me</p>
    <p>And I know it's long gone and<br />
        There was nothing else I could do<br />
        And I forget about you long enough<br />
        To forget why I needed to</p>
    <p>'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night<br />
        We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light<br />
        Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah</p>
    <p>Maybe we got lost in translation<br />
        Maybe I asked for too much<br />
        But maybe this thing was a masterpiece<br />
        'Til you tore it all up<br />
        Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well<br />
        </p>
    <p>And you call me up again just to break me like a promise<br />
        So casually cruel in the name of being honest<br />
        I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here<br />
        'Cause I remember it all, all, all<br />
        Too well</p>
    <p>Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it<br />
        I'd like to be my old self again<br />
        But I'm still trying to find it<br />
        After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own<br />
        Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone<br />
        But you keep my old scarf<br />
        From that very first week<br />
        'Cause it reminds you of innocence<br />
        And it smells like me<br />
        You can't get rid of it<br />
        'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah</p>
    <p>'Cause there we are again when I loved you so<br />
        Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known<br />
        It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</p>
    <p>Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all<br />
        Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all<br />
        It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</p>
