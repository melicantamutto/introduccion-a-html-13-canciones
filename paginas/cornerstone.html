    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>I thought I saw you in the battleship<br />
        But it was only a look a like<br />
        She was nothing but a vision trick<br />
        Under the warning light<br />
        She was close, close enough to be your ghost<br />
        But my chances turned to toast<br />
        When I asked her if I could call her your name</p>
    <p>I thought I saw you in the rusty hook<br />
        Huddled up in wicker chair<br />
        I wandered up for a closer look<br />
        And kissed who ever was sitting there</p>
    <p>She was close, and she held me very tightly<br />
        'Til I asked awfully politely, please<br />
        Can I call you her name</p>
    <p>And I elongated my lift home,<br />
        Yeah I let him go the long way round<br />
        I smelt your scent on the seat belt<br />
        And kept my shortcuts to myself</p>
    <p>I thought I saw you in the parrots beak<br />
        Messing with the smoke alarm<br />
        It was too loud for me to hear her speak<br />
        And she had a broken arm</p>
    <p>It was close, so close that the walls were wet<br />
        And she wrote it out in letraset<br />
        No you can't call me her name</p>
    <p>Tell me where's your hiding place<br />
        I'm worried I'll forget your face<br />
        And I've asked everyone<br />
        I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along</p>
    <p>I elongated my lift home<br />
        Yeah I let him go the long way 'round<br />
        I smelt your scent on the seat belt<br />
        And kept my shortcuts to myself</p>
    <p>I saw your sister in the cornerstone<br />
        On the phone to the middle man<br />
        When I saw that she was on her own<br />
        I thought she might understand</p>
    <p>She was close, well you couldn't get much closer<br />
        She said I'm really not supposed to but yes,<br />
        You can call me anything you want</p>
