    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Up on his horse, up on his horse<br />
        Not gonna wake up here anymore<br />
        Listen one time, it's not the truth<br />
        It's just a story, I tell to you<br />
        Easy to say, easy to do<br />
        But it's not easy, well, maybe for you<br />
        Hope that you find it, hope that it's good<br />
        Hope that you read it, think that you should<br />
        Cuts you some slack as he sits back<br />
        Sizes you up, plans his attack<br />
        Ah-da-da<br />
        Drums please, Fab</p>
    <p>And I got it all, I got it all<br />
        Waiting for me down on the street<br />
        But now you gotta do somethin' special for me<br />
        I'm gonna say what's on my mind<br />
        Then I'll walk out, then I'll feel fine</p>
    <p>Yeah, I'm under his thumb, I'm on his back<br />
        I will not show my teeth too quick<br />
        I needed you there, I needed you there<br />
        But I didn't know, I didn't know</p>
    <p>Go alone<br />
        I'll go alone<br />
        We'll go alone<br />
        I'll go alone</p>
    <p>Back from his trip, he's at the door<br />
        When he gets back, he's on the phone<br />
        Innocent eye, innocent heart<br />
        No, it's not wrong, but it's not right<br />
        Innocent time out on his own<br />
        Not got gonna do that, I'm out of control<br />
        I was just bored playin' the guitar<br />
        Learned all your tricks, wasn't too hard<br />
        It's the last one now, I can promise you that<br />
        I'm gonna find out the truth when I get back</p>
    <p>Gone now are the old times<br />
        Forgotten, time to hold on the railing<br />
        The Rubix cube isn't solving for us<br />
        Old friends, long forgotten<br />
        The old ways at the bottom<br />
        Of the ocean now has swallowed<br />
        The only thing that's left<br />
        Is us, so pardon the silence<br />
        That you're hearing is turning<br />
        Into a deafening, painful, shameful roar</p>
